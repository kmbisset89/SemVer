# Semantic Versioning Gradle Plugin üêò

[![Publish Plugin to Portal](https://github.com/kmbisset89/SemVer/actions/workflows/publish-plugin.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kmbisset89/SemVer/actions/workflows/publish-plugin.yaml) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cortinico/kotlin-android-template.svg)](LICENSE) ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/cortinico/kotlin-android-template?color=blue&logo=kotlin)

This repository contains a Gradle plugin designed to automate the management of project versions following [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) principles. The plugin provides tasks to bump major, minor, patch, and release candidate versions based on the project's current version and its Git history.


## How to use üë£

### Installation
To use the plugin, add the following to your project's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.github.kmbisset89.semver") version "1.0.11"
}
```

### Configuration
Configure the plugin via the simVerConfig extension in your Gradle build script:

***I recommend storing these in local.properties and not in your build.gradle file. This will prevent your sensitive information from being checked into source control.***

```properties
gitPat = yourPersonalAccessToken
gitDir = path/to/your/cloned/repo
gitEmail= yourGitEmail
```
Then use them in your build.gradle file like so:
The reason for this is that the local.properties file is not checked into source control by default, so your sensitive information will not be exposed.
The gitDirectory is here because sometimes the git directory is not in the root of the project, so you can specify it here.
```kotlin
simVerConfig {
    val properties = Properties()
    properties.load(FileInputStream(rootProject.file("local.properties")))

    gitDirectory.set(properties.getProperty("gitDir"))
    baseBranchName.set("root")
    gitEmail.set(properties.getProperty("gitEmail"))
    gitPat.set(properties.getProperty("gitPat"))
    considerLocalPropertiesFile.set(true)
}
```

#### Extension Properties
- gitDirectory: Directory of the Git repository.
- baseBranchName: The base branch for versioning.
- gitEmail: Email to use for Git operations.
- gitPat: Personal access token for Git operations.
- considerLocalPropertiesFile: Flag to consider a local properties file for configuration.

### Usage

Run the desired version bump task:

```
./gradlew bumpPatch # Bumps the patch version
./gradlew bumpMinor # Bumps the minor version
./gradlew bumpMajor # Bumps the major version
./gradlew bumpReleaseCandidate # Bumps or creates a release candidate version
```

### Recommendations for Getting Started

If you are starting with no version history, then I recommend tagging your main branch with:
```
git tag "v0.1.0"
git push --tags
```
Once you have done that, you can use the gradle task from then on out. 

### How It Works
1. Determine Current Version: The plugin identifies the current version based on the latest Git tag following SemVer principles.
2. Version Bumping: Based on the executed task, the plugin calculates the next version number.
3. Tagging and Updating: The new version is both set as the project's version and tagged in the Git repository.

## Features üé®

- **Automatic Version Detection**: Determines the project's current version based on Git tags.
- **Version Bumping**: Supports incrementing major, minor, patch versions, and creating or incrementing release candidates.
- **Git Tagging**: Automatically tags the repository with the new version after bumping.
- **Customizable Git Configuration**: Allows specifying the Git directory, branch, user, and personal access token (PAT) for operations requiring authentication.
