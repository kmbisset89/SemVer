## How to use üë£


## Features üé®





## Publishing üöÄ

This template is ready to let you publish to [Gradle Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

The [![Publish Plugin to Portal](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/workflows/Publish%20Plugin%20to%20Portal/badge.svg?branch=1.0.0)](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-gradle-plugin-template/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+Plugin+to+Portal%22) Github Action will take care of the publishing whenever you **push a tag**.

Please note that you need to configure two secrets: `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY` and `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET` with the credetials you can get from your profile on the Gradle Portal.

## 100% Kotlin üÖ∫

This template is designed to use Kotlin everywhere. The build files are written using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml).

Moreover, a minimalistic Gradle Plugin is already provided in Kotlin to let you easily start developing your own around it.

## Static Analysis üîç

This template is using [**ktlint**](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) with the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) plugin to format your code. To reformat all the source code as well as the buildscript you can run the `ktlintFormat` gradle task.

This template is also using [**detekt**](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task).

## CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Validate Gradle Wrapper](.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- [Pre Merge Checks](.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) - Will run the `preMerge` tasks as well as trying to run the Gradle plugin.
- [Publish to Plugin Portal](.github/workflows/publish-plugin.yaml) - Will run the `publishPlugin` task when pushing a new tag.
